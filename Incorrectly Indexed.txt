AB  - Apple unveiled its highly anticipated mixed-reality headset, called the Apple Vision Pro on June 5, 2023. The primary user interface relies on eye tracking, hand, gestures, cameras, and sensors, eliminating the need for physical controllers such as keyboards or touch screens. The refined capabilities of this technology can be utilized for diverse purposes, including but not limited to medical and surgical education, and remote medical consultations. All things considered, virtual reality is a highly promising area for the future of medicine, from improving medical education and vision screening to physical and psychological rehabilitation. We look forward to further innovations in this exciting area for years to come.

AB  - The valid assessment of vocabulary development in dual-language-learning infants is critical to developmental science. We developed the Dual Language Learners English-Spanish (DLL-ES) Inventories to measure vocabularies of U.S. English-Spanish DLLs. The inventories provide translation equivalents for all Spanish and English items on Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) short forms; extended inventories based on CDI long forms; and Spanish language-variety options. Item-Response Theory analyses applied to Wordbank and Web-CDI data (n = 2603, 12-18 months; n = 6722, 16-36 months; half female; 1% Asian, 3% Black, 2% Hispanic, 30% White, 64% unknown) showed near-perfect associations between DLL-ES and CDI long-form scores. Interviews with 10 Hispanic mothers of 18- to 24-month-olds (2 White, 1 Black, 7 multi-racial; 6 female) provide a proof of concept for the value of the DLL-ES for assessing the vocabularies of DLLs.

AB  - Historically, a scarcity of comprehensive longitudinal microdata has affected comparative research on the interplay between self-identified race, immigrant status, and educational attainment. Thus, this study utilizes ethnic capital theory and harmonized data from Toronto, Canada, and Sydney, Australia, to scrutinize the success of ethnolinguistically diverse immigrants in accessing university education. While students from certain East Asian countries enter universities at higher rates in both cities, dissecting the intricacies of ethnic capital's operation proves challenging. Notably, first- and second-generation migrants who speak Chinese, Japanese, or Korean outdo their peers in university admissions by a larger margin in Toronto than in Sydney. However, the shortcomings of the administrative data in Toronto and the survey data in Sydney limit how we can interpret this finding. We postulate expanding existing data collections to enable insightful research on how the educational trajectories of Canadian students compare to those elsewhere with respect to immigration experiences, race, and ethnicity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to simplify reporting of outcomes in congenital heart surgery that compares well-defined patient groups and accommodates multiple stakeholder needs while being easily understandable. METHODS: We selected 19 commonly performed congenital heart surgeries ranging in complexity from repair of atrial septal defects to the Norwood procedure. Strict inclusion/exclusion criteria ensured the creation of 19 well-defined diagnosis/procedure cohorts. Preoperative, procedural, and postoperative data were collected for consecutive eligible patients from 9 centers between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021. Unadjusted operative mortality rates and hospital length of stay for each of the 19 diagnosis/procedure cohorts were summarized in aggregate and stratified by each center. RESULTS: Of 8572 eligible cases included, numbers in the 19 diagnosis/procedure cohorts ranged from 73 for tetralogy of Fallot repair after previous palliation to 1224 for ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair for isolated VSD. In aggregate, the unadjusted mortality ranged from 0% for atrial septal defect repair to 28.4% for hybrid stage I. There was significant heterogeneity in case mix and mortality for different diagnosis/procedure cohorts across centers (eg, arterial switch operation/VSD, n = 7-42, mortality 0%-7.4%; Norwood procedure, n = 16-122, mortality 5.3%-25%). CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of institutional case volumes and outcomes within well-defined diagnosis/procedure cohorts can enable centers to benchmark outcomes, understand trends in mortality, and direct quality improvement. When made public, this type of report could provide parents with information on institutional volumes and outcomes and allow them to better understand the experience of each program with operations for specific congenital heart defects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of menstrual tracking data to understand abnormal bleeding patterns has been limited because of lack of incorporation of key demographic and health characteristics and confirmation of menstrual tracking accuracy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify abnormal uterine bleeding patterns and their prevalence and confirm existing and expected associations between abnormal uterine bleeding patterns, demographics, and medical conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Apple Women's Health Study participants from November 2019 through July 2021 who contributed menstrual tracking data and did not report pregnancy, lactation, use of hormones, or menopause were included in the analysis. Four abnormal uterine bleeding patterns were evaluated: irregular menses, infrequent menses, prolonged menses, and irregular intermenstrual bleeding (spotting). Monthly tracking confirmation using survey responses was used to exclude inaccurate or incomplete digital records. We investigated the prevalence of abnormal uterine bleeding stratified by demographic characteristics and used logistic regression to evaluate the relationship of abnormal uterine bleeding to a number of self-reported medical conditions. RESULTS: There were 18,875 participants who met inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 33 (standard deviation, 8.2) years, mean body mass index of 29.3 (standard deviation, 8.0), and with 68.9% (95% confidence interval, 68.2-69.5) identifying as White, non-Hispanic. Abnormal uterine bleeding was found in 16.4% of participants (n=3103; 95% confidence interval, 15.9-17.0) after accurate tracking was confirmed; 2.9% had irregular menses (95% confidence interval, 2.7-3.1), 8.4% had infrequent menses (95% confidence interval, 8.0-8.8), 2.3% had prolonged menses (95% confidence interval, 2.1-2.5), and 6.1% had spotting (95% confidence interval, 5.7-6.4). Black participants had 33% higher prevalence (prevalence ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.61) of infrequent menses compared with White, non-Hispanic participants after controlling for age and body mass index. The prevalence of infrequent menses was increased in class 1, 2, and 3 obesity (class 1: body mass index, 30-34.9; prevalence ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.52; class 2: body mass index, 35-39.9; prevalence ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.49; class 3: body mass index, >40; prevalence ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.88) after controlling for age and race/ethnicity. Those with class 3 obesity had 18% higher prevalence of abnormal uterine bleeding compared with healthy-weight participants (prevalence ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.38). Participants with polycystic ovary syndrome had 19% higher prevalence of abnormal uterine bleeding compared with participants without this condition (prevalence ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.31). Participants with hyperthyroidism (prevalence ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.59) and hypothyroidism (prevalence ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.31) had a higher prevalence of abnormal uterine bleeding, as did those reporting endometriosis (prevalence ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.45), cervical dysplasia (prevalence ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.39), and fibroids (prevalence ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.30). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, abnormal uterine bleeding was present in 16.4% of those with confirmed menstrual tracking. Black or obese participants had increased prevalence of abnormal uterine bleeding. Participants reporting conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid disease, endometriosis, and cervical dysplasia had a higher prevalence of abnormal uterine bleeding.

AB  - This study assessed the concurrent validity and test-retest-reliability of the Apple Health app on iPhone for measuring gait parameters in different age groups. Twenty-seven children, 28 adults and 28 seniors equipped with an iPhone completed a 6-min walk test (6MWT). Gait speed (GS), step length (SL), and double support time (DST) were extracted from the gait recordings of the Health app. Gait parameters were simultaneously collected with an inertial sensors system (APDM Mobility Lab) to assess concurrent validity. Test-retest reliability was assessed via a second iPhone-instrumented 6MWT 1 week later. Agreement of the Health App with the APDM Mobility Lab was good for GS in all age groups and for SL in adults/seniors, but poor to moderate for DST in all age groups and for SL in children. Consistency between repeated measurements was good to excellent for all gait parameters in adults/seniors, and moderate to good for GS and DST but poor for SL in children. The Health app on iPhone is reliable and valid for measuring GS and SL in adults and seniors. Careful interpretation is required when using the Health app in children and when measuring DST in general, as both have shown limited validity and/or reliability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a kind of metabolic syndrome (MetS) that seriously threatens human health globally. The leaf of star apple (Chrysophyllum cainito L.) is an incompletely explored folk medicine on diabetes. And, the effects and mechanisms on diabetes complicated glycolipid metabolism disorders are unknown till now. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the constituents of star apple leaf polyphenol enriched-fraction (SAP), and elucidate their treatment effects and mechanism on diabetes and accompanied other MetS. METHODS: The components of SAP were tentatively identified by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The antioxidant activity was determined by the scavenging of free radicals and hypoglycemic activities by inhibition of α-glucosidase in vitro. HepG2 cells were used for evaluating the alleviation effects of SAP on lipid accumulation. Streptozotocin and high-fat diet induced diabetic mice were grouped to evaluate the effects of different dosages of SAP. 16S rRNA was conducted to analysis gut microbiome-mediated glucose and lipid metabolism mechanism. RESULTS: It showed that myricitrin was one of the main active constituents of SAP. SAP not only showed low IC50 on -glucosidase (24.427± 0.626 μg/mL), OH·(3.680± 0.054 μg/mL) and ABTS· (9.155±0.234 μg/mL), but significantly induced the lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells (p < 0.05). SAP at 200 mg/kg·day significantly decreased the blood glucose, insulin and oral glucose tolerance test value (p < 0.05). The insulin resistance indexes and oxidative stress were alleviated after administration. SAP not only attenuated hepatic lipid deposition, but also reversed the hepatic glycogen storage. 16S rRNA sequencing results revealed that the interaction between SAP and gut microbiota led to the positive regulation of beneficial bacteria including Akkermansia, Unspecified S24_7, Alistipes and Unspecified_Ruminococcaceae, which might be one of the mechanisms of SAP on MetS. CONCLUSION: For the first time, this study explored the regulation effect of star apple leaf polyphenols on the hepatic glycolipid metabolism and studied the underlying mechanism from the view of gut microbiota. These findings indicated that SAP possesses great potential to serve as a complementary medicine for diabetes and associated MetS. It provided scientific evidence for folk complementary medicine on the treatment of diabetes-complicated multiple metabolic disorders.

AB  - Borassus flabellifer L., commonly known as Asian palmyra, is native to South and Southeast Asia. The endosperms of B. flabellifer (known as nungu in Dravidian culture) are widely consumed during the summer season. It is rich in various nutrients and helps in reducing weight, treating skin and digestive issues, lowering body temperature, and managing migraines and diabetes. This study focuses on identifying the small molecules and proteins from the two varieties of B. flabellifer tender fruit endosperms collected from districts around Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The collected free nuclear endosperm was subjected to direct extraction and the mesocarp and cellular endosperms were lyophilized and homogenized. Metabolites were extracted by hexane, methanol, and chloroform and investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The compounds identified were from the classes of carboxylic acids, flavonoids, amino acids, alkaloids, fatty acids, oligopeptides, vitamins, and glycosides. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique was employed to estimate the quantity of amino acids, wherein the total amino acid in the green variety was found to be higher than in the black variety. Proteins were identified after simulating with a gastrointestinal enzyme using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based peptide mass fingerprinting. The different mineral oxides present in the tender fruit endosperm were identified using X-ray diffraction studies, which confirmed the presence of mineral oxides, such as Br(1.25)ClO(2.75)Pb(3.88), calcium zirconium tantalum oxide, and barium fluoroniobate. This study validates the presence of bioactive metabolites in green and black varieties of B. flabellifer tender fruit endosperm with a range of activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer, and anti-diabetic properties.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate images and videos behind the anterior segment of cataract surgery with the porcine eye using a new Miyake-Apple View with a nasal endoscope. SETTING: Sugiura Eye Clinic, Fuji, Shizuoka, Japan. DESIGN: Laboratory study. METHOD: A hole was made in a commercially available wooden desk and the nasal endoscope was fixed under the desk. A tunnel for passing the probe of the nasal endoscope was opened on a Styrofoam human-faced base, and the probe was passed through. A 3 mm × 3 mm incision was made behind the globe, and a nasal endoscope probe was inserted to observe the posterior anterior segment of the eye. RESULT: The posterior part of the anterior segment of the eye could be clearly observed, and each procedure (hydrodissection, phacoemulsification, irrigation and aspiration, and insertion and fixation of intraocular lens [IOL]) in normal cataract surgery could be observed from the posterior. Lighting could be improved. CONCLUSIONS: The conventional Miyake-Apple View required a large-scale custom-made device, which was expensive and could not be taken easily, and required to cut the globe and a technique to fix it to the glass plate. However, this method made it easy to prepare for shooting, and the equipment was inexpensive. Furthermore, it had the great advantage of not having to cut the globe. Since the integrity of the globe was maintained, normal cataract surgery could be reproduced and dynamic observation from the back became possible. It was useful for practicing cataract surgery and examining the fixed state of new IOLs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biological sex influences both overall adiposity and fat distribution. Further, testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) influence adiposity and metabolic function, with differential effects of testosterone in men and women. Here, we aimed to perform sex-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of body fat percentage (BFPAdj) (adjusting for testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) to increase statistical power. METHODS: GWAS were performed in white British individuals from the UK Biobank (157,937 males and 154,337 females). To avoid collider bias, loci associated with SHBG or testosterone were excluded. We investigated association of BFPAdj loci with high density cholesterol (HDL), triglyceride (TG), type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), and MRI-derived abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and gluteofemoral adipose tissue (GFAT) using publicly available data from large GWAS. We also performed 2-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) using identified BFPAdj variants as instruments to investigate causal effect of BFPAdj on HDL, TG, T2D and CAD in males and females separately. RESULTS: We identified 195 and 174 loci explaining 3.35% and 2.60% of the variation in BFPAdj in males and females, respectively at genome-wide significance (GWS, p<5x10(-8)). Although the direction of effect at these loci was generally concordant in males and females, only 38 loci were common to both sexes at GWS. Seven loci in males and ten loci in females have not been associated with any adiposity/cardiometabolic traits previously. BFPAdj loci generally did not associate with cardiometabolic traits; several had paradoxically beneficial cardiometabolic effects with favourable fat distribution. MR analyses did not find convincing supportive evidence that increased BFPAdj has deleterious cardiometabolic effects in either sex with highly significant heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: There was limited genetic overlap between BFPAdj in males and females at GWS. BFPAdj loci generally did not have adverse cardiometabolic effects which may reflect the effects of favourable fat distribution and cardiometabolic risk modulation by testosterone and SHBG.

AB  - Historians have shown how the establishment of human genetic counselling in West Germany was characterised by several sociohistorical factors, in particular the impact of the legacies of Nazi biopolitics. These accounts have reconstructed continuities on an intellectual level which delayed a turn towards non-directive approaches, emphasising individual (emotional) well-being and voluntariness, and instead have prolonged a discourse that defined disability as an economic and social burden. However, while the distinct legacies of eugenics and racial hygienics are well researched, other factors that constituted counselling encounters, such as the ways of communicating reproduction and material objects' roles in transformations of concepts, actors and their relations, have not been examined in detail. Drawing on the archives of a Marburg-based charity, this paper aimed to reconstruct these factors at the example of the production and circulation of a major family planning leaflet, Our Child Shall Be Healthy, developed ca 1977. In doing so, I want to suggest that connections between science, politics and economy were a key element in technologies of communicating reproduction. This essay approaches counselling as a communicative practice that was in continual productive engagement with different concepts of reproductive health. First, it argues that the communicative and paper technologies used in counselling interactions in West Germany changed in the aftermath of the worldwide thalidomide tragedy. Second, it argues that a novel approach to reproductive health emerged that focused on individual decision making as the basis of prosperity and emotional well-being. Taking a family planning leaflet as a site for reconstructing how people of different organisations, with different stakes and expertise converged in the design of a counselling encounter, this paper targets the crossroads of economic, political and scientific activities in the history of communicating reproductive health and reproductive risks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 containment measures curb viral spread but may hamper walking mobility. As a low daily step count is associated with increased noncommunicable diseases and mortality, assessing the relationship between pandemic responses and walking mobility can help trade-off public health measures. We investigated the association between containment stringency and walking mobility across 60 countries in the period between January 21, 2020 and January 21, 2022 and modeled how this could impact mortality hazard. METHODS: Walking mobility was measured through the Apple Mobility Trends, containment measures stringency index through the Oxford COVID-19 response tracker (which considers local policies on closures, healthcare, and economy), and meteorological data by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather stations. Walking mobility was regressed over stringency in a mixed-effect model with weather variables as covariates. The impact of stringency on all-cause mortality due to reduced mobility was modeled based on regression results, prepandemic walking mobility, and the association between step count and all-cause mortality hazard. RESULTS: Across the 60 countries, the average stringency was 55 (9) (mean [SD]) out of 100. Stringency was negatively associated with walking mobility; a log-linear model fitted data better than a linear one, with a regression coefficient for stringency on ln (walking mobility) (95% confidence interval) of  -1.201 × 10-2 (-1.221 × 10-2 to -1.183 × 10-2). Increasing stringency, thus decreasing walking mobility, nonlinearly incremented the modeled all-cause mortality hazard by up to ∼40%. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, walking mobility was negatively associated with containment measures stringency; the relationship between stringency, mobility, and the subsequent impact on health outcomes may be nonlinear. These findings can help in balancing pandemic containment policies.

AB  - Obesity has been recognized as one of the most significant risk factors for the deterioration and mortality associated with COVID-19, but the significance of obesity itself differs among ethnicity. Multifactored analysis of our single institute-based retrospective cohort revealed that high visceral adipose tissue (VAT) burden, but not other obesity-associated markers, was related to accelerated inflammatory responses and the mortality of Japanese COVID-19 patients. To elucidate the mechanisms how VAT-dominant obesity induces severe inflammation after severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we infected two different strains of obese mice, C57BL/6JHamSlc-ob/ob (ob/ob), C57BLKS/J-db/db (db/db), genetically impaired in the leptin ligand and receptor, respectively, and control C57BL/6 mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. Here, we revealed that VAT-dominant ob/ob mice were extremely more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 due to excessive inflammatory responses when compared to SAT-dominant db/db mice. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 genome and proteins were more abundant in the lungs of ob/ob mice, engulfed in macrophages, resulting in increased cytokine production including interleukin (IL)-6. Both an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody treatment and the prevention of obesity by leptin replenishment improved the survival of SARS-CoV-2-infected ob/ob mice by reducing the viral protein burden and excessive immune responses. Our results have proposed unique insights and clues on how obesity increases the risk of cytokine storm and death in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, earlier administration of antiinflammatory therapeutics including anti-IL-6R antibody to VAT-dominant patients might improve clinical outcome and stratification of the treatment for COVID-19, at least in Japanese patients.

AB  - Regular scouting for plant diseases and insect pests by growers, crop consultants, extension educators, and researchers (herein defined as stakeholders) is the cornerstone of integrated pest management practices. Sequential sampling plans have the potential to save time and labor in field scouting and reduce the frequency of errors surrounding decision-making. The incorporation of the algorithms behind sequential sampling plans into mobile devices can make scouting for diseases and insect pests more straightforward, practical, and enjoyable. Here, we introduce an iOS application called Sampling. The application was designed for stakeholders to use on a mobile device for assessing disease and insect pest incidence in the field using sequential sampling plans. The application allows users to select a disease or insect pest from a prepopulated list and specify the objective of sampling: Estimation or classification. Conducting sequential sampling depends upon different precision levels and action thresholds within each objective. Detailed instructions for each sequential sampling plan are available as a guide. When sampling begins, users enter the number of diseased individuals at each sampling unit. The specific algorithm developed for the disease or insect pest will inform the user when to stop sampling for the desired goal and return the final incidence and precision or threshold achieved. Results are automatically saved in the application, and the user can inspect and share results by exporting them to a range of compatible programs. The initial version of Sampling (1.1) was released with the sequential sampling plans for Cercospora leaf spot of table beet. Sequential sampling plans for additional diseases or pests will be added to Sampling in subsequent versions. Sampling is available as a free download from the Apple Store (https://apple.co/3pUiYKy) and is compatible with iOS 14.0 or greater on the iPhone or iPad.

AB  - PURPOSE: The smaller incision, new-generation implantable miniature telescope is a novel implant to optimize vision in retinal patients with central vision loss. Using Miyake-Apple techniques we visualized the device implantation, repositioning, and explantation, while noting capsular bag dynamics. METHODS: Using the Miyake-Apple technique, we assessed capsular bag deformation after successful implantation of the device in human autopsy eyes. We assessed rescue strategies for converting a sulcus implantation to a capsular implantation and explantation strategies. We noted the occurrence of posterior capsule striae, zonular stress, and the haptics' arc of contact with the capsular bag after implantation. RESULTS: Acceptable zonular stress was observed during the successful implantation of the SING IMT. When it was implanted in the sulcus, one could reposition the haptics into the bag with two spatulas using counter-pressure in an effective strategy despite inducing tolerable, medium zonular stress. A similar technique, in reverse, allows safe explantation without damaging the rhexis or the bag, while inducing similar medium, tolerable zonular stress. In all eyes we examined, the implant considerably stretches the bag, inducing a capsular bag deformation and posterior capsule striae. CONCLUSION: The SING IMT can be safely implanted without significant zonular stress. In sulcus implantation and explantation, repositioning of the haptic is achievable without perturbing zonular stress using the presented approaches. It stretches average-sized capsular bags to support its weight. This is achieved by an increased arc of contact of the haptics with the capsular equator.

AB  - Comorbid externalizing and internalizing disorders are common in offspring of a parent with bipolar I or II disorder. In some cases, the symptoms are harbingers of future bipolar spectrum disorder. Even when they are not, they are likely to be impairing to the child. Clinicians need to be better informed about how the history leading up to mania/hypomania unfolds, and what comorbid disorders are impairing in and of themselves. More information is needed about the parents' psychopathology, course of illness and response to treatment. Until we have data on how to prevent bipolar disorder, the best course of action is to treat the child's current impairing symptoms and render the parent as asymptomatic as possible.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare 1 new intraocular lens (IOL) injector system against 3 standard injector systems in porcine eyes. SETTING: David J Apple Center for Vision Research, Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. DESIGN: In vitro laboratory study. METHODS: In 70 porcine eyes, +20.0 diopter IOLs were implanted with the following systems: multiSert, UltraSert, iTec, and RayOne, that is, S1.8 (incision size: 1.8 mm), S2.0 (2.0 mm), S2.2P (2.2 mm, push mode), S2.2S (2.2 mm, screw mode), U2.2 (2.2 mm), iT2.2 (2.2 mm), and R2.0 (2.0 mm). Corneal incision sizes were measured before and after implantation with an incision gauge set. Ease of use was evaluated using a Likert scale. IOL delivery time and performance were determined based on Miyake-Apple view videos. RESULTS: Of the 70 eyes studied, the incision enlargements were 0.36 ± 0.08 mm (S1.8), 0.15 ± 0.07 mm (S2.0), 0.17 ± 0.12 mm (S2.2P), 0.28 ± 0.10 mm (S2.2S), 0.32 ± 0.09 mm (U2.2), 0.30 ± 0.08 mm (iT2.2), and 0.35 ± 0.11 mm (R2.0). Total scores of ease of use were 23.00 (S1.8), 25.00 (S2.0), 29.00 (S2.2P), 26.00 (S2.2S), 26.00 (U2.2), 25.00 (iT2.2), and 24.00 (R2.0). As for the mean delivery time, iT2.2 took the longest time (13.20 ± 3.29 seconds), whereas S2.2S took the shortest time (4.50 ± 0.71 seconds). Optic-haptic adhesion was observed in S1.8 (4, 40%), S2.2P (2, 20%), U2.2 (5, 50%), and iT2.2 (5, 50%). CONCLUSIONS: Injector S, with the appropriate incision size and implantation method, could achieve better results regarding incision enlargement, ease of use, delivery time, and performance than other injector systems. There was an indirect relationship between incision size and inadvertent events.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the dynamics between capsular bags and different intraocular lens (IOL) models in human cadaver eyes using the Miyake-Apple posterior view technique. METHODS: In an in vitro laboratory study, human cadaver eyes were prepared according to the Miyake-Apple posterior view technique. Five IOLs from each of the six groups (Avansee 1P [Simonvision], Avansee 3P [Simonvision], CT Lucia [Carl Zeiss Meditec], Acrysof [Alcon Laboratories, Inc], RayOne [Rayner], and CT Asphina [Carl Zeiss Meditec]) were implanted into capsular bags with different diameters. The empty capsular bag diameter and capsular bag diameter with an IOL in it were evaluated based on the Miyake-Apple view pictures. Posterior capsule striae were observed and compared between groups. The arc of contact between IOLs and the capsular equator was noted. Correlations between the empty capsular bag diameter and the capsular bag diameter with IOL, as well as between the empty capsular bag diameter and the arc of contact, were examined. With the Avansee 3P as a reference, the area deviation of the haptics of IOL models with looped haptics was compared. RESULTS: The capsular bag diameter with IOL inside and the arc of contact were proportional to the empty capsular bag diameter. The RayOne, Avansee 3P, and CT Lucia showed a longer arc of contact. Posterior capsule striae were observed in the Avansee 1P (1, 20%), Avansee 3P (5, 100%), Acrysof (1, 20%), and RayOne (2, 40%). Areas of deviation were 0.38 mm(2) (Avansee 1P), 0.24 mm(2) (CT Lucia), 0.34 mm(2) (Acrysof), and 0.31 mm(2) (RayOne), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Different IOL models showed varied characteristics in terms of capsular bag fitting and arc of contact. Understanding these dynamics is critical to optimizing postoperative outcomes.

AB  - We previously characterized a human betaretrovirus and linked infection with the development of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). There are in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating that antiretroviral therapy used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be repurposed to treat betaretroviruses. As such, PBC patients have been treated with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), alone and in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor in case studies and clinical trials. However, a randomized controlled trial using combination antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir was terminated early because 70% of PBC patients discontinued therapy because of gastrointestinal side effects. In the open-label extension, patients tolerating combination therapy underwent a significant reduction in serum liver parameters, whereas those on NRTIs alone rebounded to baseline. Herein, we compare clinical experience in the experimental use of antiretroviral agents in patients with PBC with the broader experience of using these agents in people living with HIV infection. While the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects in the PBC population appears somewhat increased compared to those with HIV infection, the clinical improvement observed in patients with PBC suggests that further studies using the newer and better tolerated antiretroviral agents are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Family Affective Attitude Rating Scale (FAARS) uses an audio-recorded speech sample to measure parents' affective attitudes toward their children. The present study investigated the psychometric properties of this scale for use with fathers, concurrent predictors of paternal affective attitudes (parental depressive symptoms, inter-parental relationship quality, observed paternal parenting), and associations between fathers' positive and negative affective attitudes toward their two-year-old children and children's behavior problems one year later. METHODS: Participants were a sample (N = 226) of families from the Early Steps Multisite Study, a longitudinal study of low-income parents and children. Participants were racially and ethnically diverse (65% white; 23% Black or biracial; 12% Latinx). RESULTS: Initial validation results support the reliability and validity of FAARS coding in fathers of preschoolers, a previously untested group. Both maternal and paternal depressive symptoms and interparental relationship quality were significantly associated with fathers' affective attitudes toward their children. Further, fathers' positive affective attitudes predicted lower mother-reported child behavior problems one year later, controlling for a host of demographic covariates, fathers' observed parenting, mothers' affective attitudes, and child baseline behavior problems. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that fathers' positive attitudes toward their young children are a unique and robust predictor of lower levels of early behavior problems.

AB  - Vehicle systems have been one of the fastest-growing fields in recent years. Vehicles are extremely helpful for understanding driver behaviors and have received significant attention from a forensic perspective. Extensive forensic research was previously conducted on on-board vehicle systems, such as an event data recorders, located in the electronic control unit or manufacturer-based infotainment systems. However, unlike previous vehicles that used only manufacturer-based infotainment systems, most vehicles today are equipped with infotainment systems such as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. These in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems connect to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The vehicle can periodically communicate with a smartphone and thus a network outside the vehicle. Drivers can use more services in their vehicles than ever before. Accordingly, an increasing number of diverse data are being stored in vehicles, with mobile devices connected to both the vehicle and the cloud. Such data include information that can be of significant help to investigators in solving problems during forensic investigations. Therefore, forensics of IVI systems such as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are becoming increasingly important. We analyzed various forensic studies conducted on Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Most of the research was mainly focused on mobile devices connected through a wired USB connection. The use of wireless-based IVI systems has recently been increasing. However, the analysis of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay from this point of view is insufficient. Therefore, we proposed a forensic methodology that fully considers such limitations. A forensic analysis was conducted on various IVI systems. We also developed an IVI system forensics tool that works based on the proposed methodology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile applications offer a new approach to personal health records, which are internet-based tools for patients to consolidate and manage their health information. The University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) was one of the first health systems to participate in Apple Health Records (AHR), a prominent example of this new generation of personal health records. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize early adoption of AHR among UPHS patients and understand user perspectives. METHODS: An email-based survey with fixed answer, Likert scale, and open-ended questions was administered to all UPHS patients using AHR in the first 10 months of enrollment. Survey data linked to the UPHS electronic health record system were used to analyze responses. Multivariable logistic regression modeled the association of patient characteristics with user ratings. Content analysis was used to analyze open-ended questions. RESULTS: At the time of the survey, a total of 1458 patients had used AHR at least once. Mean age of AHR users was 47.5 years, 66.3% (967/1458) were male, 70.9% (1033/1458) were white, and 80.8% (1178/1458) had private insurance. Response rate was 26.8% (391/1458); 46.3% (180/389) were very satisfied with AHR, and 67.7% (264/390) described it as very easy to use. The most commonly utilized features were lab results (324/391, 82.9%), clinical vitals (264/391, 67.5%), and medications (253/391, 64.7%). No patient characteristics were associated with reporting high satisfaction or ease of use. The most common reason for using AHR was convenience/ease of use, and 58.2% (160/275) of users reported allowing no other apps to access their health information, citing privacy as one consideration. CONCLUSIONS: Early adopters of AHR were demographically white, male, and privately insured. Convenience was an important facilitator, and users were selective in which apps they allowed to access their health information.

AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Physical activity tracking devices have potential to improve public health, but their data needs to be reliable. No study has compared movement data between the Fitbit Zip, Apple iPhone Health app and physical activity records in a community setting over 10 days. METHODS: University students aged 18+ years wore both a Fitbit Zip and an iPhone at/near their right waist and completed a modified Bouchard Activity Record (BAR) for 10 days in a free-living setting. Comparisons were made between the Fitbit Zip and iPhone for the number of steps and the distance travelled and between the Fitbit Zip and BAR for the minutes of activity in three different intensities. RESULTS: Eighteen students provided sufficient data for inclusion. There were strong correlations between steps per day (r = .87) and distance travelled (r = .88) between the Fitbit Zips and iPhones. However, the Fitbit Zip measured significantly more steps per day (mean 8437 vs 7303; P ≤ .001) and greater distances (mean 5.9 vs 4.9; P ≤ .001) than the iPhone. Correlations between the Fitbit Zips and the BARs were moderate for minutes of total (r = .51) and light (r = .40) activity and weak for moderate/fairly active (r = .20) and vigorous/very active (r = .25). CONCLUSIONS: There were strong correlations between the physical activity data measured by Fitbit Zips and iPhones, but the iPhone Health app significantly underestimated the number of steps per day taken and the distance travelled when compared to the Fitbit Zip. SO WHAT?: Understanding the comparability of accelerometer devices provides useful information for future pragmatic physical activity measurement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large-scale trials of multidomain interventions show that modifying lifestyle and psychological risk factors can slow cognitive decline. We aim to determine if a lower intensity, personally tailored secondary dementia prevention programme for older people with subjective or mild objective memory decline, informed by behaviour change theory, reduces cognitive decline over 2 years. METHODS: A multi-site, single-blind randomised controlled trial recruiting 704 older adults at high dementia risk due to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Participants are randomised using 1:1 allocation ratio to the APPLE Tree intervention versus control arm (dementia prevention information), stratified by site. The intervention explores and implements strategies to promote healthy lifestyle, increase pleasurable activities and social connections and improve long-term condition self-management. Two facilitators trained and supervised by a clinical psychologist deliver ten, 1-h group video call sessions over 6 months (approximately every fortnight), video-call 'tea breaks' (less structured, facilitated social sessions) in intervening weeks and individual goal-setting phone calls every 2 weeks. From 6 to 12 months, participants meet monthly for 'tea breaks', with those not attending receiving monthly goal-setting phone calls. Participants receive a food delivery, pedometer and website access to cognitive training and information about lifestyle modification. Follow-ups for all outcome measures are at 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome is cognition (Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) score) at 24 months. Secondary outcomes are quality of life, cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and wellbeing and lifestyle factors the intervention targets (diet, vascular risk, body weight, activity, sleep, anxiety, depression, social networks and loneliness, alcohol intake and smoking). Participants from purposively selected sites participate in qualitative process evaluation interviews, which will be analysed using thematic analytic methods. DISCUSSION: If effective, the intervention design, involving remote delivery and non-clinical facilitators, would facilitate intervention roll-out to older people with memory concerns. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN17325135 . Registration date 27 November 2019.

AB  - The Plasminogen-Apple-Nematode (PAN) domain, with a core of four to six cysteine residues, is found in > 28,000 proteins across 959 genera. Still, its role in protein function is not fully understood. The PAN domain was initially characterized in numerous proteins, including HGF. Dysregulation of HGF-mediated signaling results in multiple deadly cancers. The binding of HGF to its cell surface receptor, c-MET, triggers all biological impacts. Here, we show that mutating four core cysteine residues in the HGF PAN domain reduces c-MET interaction, subsequent c-MET autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation of its downstream targets, perinuclear localization, cellular internalization of HGF, and its receptor, c-MET, and c-MET ubiquitination. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of HGF/c-MET signaling-related genes involved in cancer progression, invasion, metastasis, and cell survival were impaired. Thus, targeting the PAN domain of HGF may represent a mechanism for selectively regulating the binding and activation of the c-MET pathway.

AB  - One-third of all intestinal obstructions in the newborn are caused by atresias. The most common site is the duodenum followed by jejunoileal and colonic locations. Herein we report the autopsy findings of a rare case of jejunoileal atresia associated with malrotation of gut. Autopsy performed on a 36 weeks old male fetus still birth, born of a non-consanguineous marriage, demonstrated jejunoileal atresia with apple peel deformity and malrotation of gut. Although the diagnosis was established in the prenatal period, in utero fetal demise occurred before definitive surgical intervention could be done. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and intervention.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Duodenal atresia associated with apple peel is extremely rare. Duodenal atresia occurs as a result of absence of recanalization at an early stage, whereas intestinal atresia is seemingly due to vascular causes at later stages. The presence of abnormalities associated with diaphragmatic hernia is frequent, but association with duodenal atresia has been little explored. CASE REPORT: This is the case of a female neonate born at gestational week 31, with duodenal atresia and apple peel, associated with left diaphragmatic hernia and major heart disease. An abdominal muscle flap was performed for diaphragmatic defect closure purposes, and duodenojejunal anastomosis was carried out following resection of part of the non-viable apple peel. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case described with this rare association. The combination of duodenal atresia and apple peel had been previously described 11 times. However, the association of both with congenital diaphragmatic hernia had not been reported yet.

AB  - Organ donation networks audit and report on national or regional organ donation performance, however there are inconsistencies in the metrics and definitions used, rendering comparisons difficult or inappropriate. This is despite multiple attempts exploring the possibility for convergently evolving audits so that collectives of donation networks might transparently share data and practice and then target system interventions. This paper represents a collaboration between the United Kingdom and Australian organ donation organisations which aimed to understand the intricacies of our respective auditing systems, compare the metrics and definitions they employ and ultimately assess their level of comparability. This point of view outlines the historical context underlying the development of the auditing tools, demonstrates their differences to the Critical Pathway proposed as a common tool a decade ago and presents a side-by-side comparison of donation definitions, metrics and data for the 2019 calendar year. There were significant differences in donation definition terminology, metrics and overall structure of the audits. Fitting the audits to a tiered scaffold allowed for reasonable comparisons however this required substantial effort and understanding of nuance. Direct comparison of international and inter-regional donation performance is challenging and would benefit from consistent auditing processes across organisations.

AB  - In this paper, the authors have compared all of the currently available Apple MacBook Pro laptops, in terms of their usability for basic machine learning research applications (text-based, vision-based, tabular). The paper presents four tests/benchmarks, comparing four Apple Macbook Pro laptop versions: Intel based (i5) and three Apple based (M1, M1 Pro and M1 Max). A script in the Swift programming language was prepared, whose goal was to conduct the training and evaluation process for four machine learning (ML) models. It used the Create ML framework-Apple's solution dedicated to ML model creation on macOS devices. The training and evaluation processes were performed three times. While running, the script performed measurements of their performance, including the time results. The results were compared with each other in tables, which allowed to compare and discuss the performance of individual devices and the benefits of the specificity of their hardware architectures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that emergent events may affect pregnancy planning decisions. However, few have investigated the effect of factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnancy planning, measured by attempting conception, and how attempting conception status may differ by individual-level factors, such as social status or educational level. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effects of factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, until March 2021, on attempting conception status and to assess the effect measure modification by educational level and subjective social status. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a longitudinal analysis within a subgroup of 21,616 participants in the Apple Women's Health Study who enrolled from November 2019 to March 2021, who met the inclusion criteria, and who responded to the monthly status menstrual update question on attempting conception status (yes or no). Participants reporting hysterectomy, pregnancy, lactation, or menopause were excluded. We used generalized estimating equation methodology to fit logistic regression models that estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between the proportion of participants attempting conception and the month of response (compared with a prepandemic reference month of February 2020) while accounting for longitudinal correlation and adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, and marital status. We stratified the analysis by social status and educational level. RESULTS: We observed a trend of reduced odds of attempting conception, with an 18% reduction in the odds of attempting conception in August 2020 and October 2020 compared with the prepandemic month of February 2020 (August odds ratio: 0.82 [95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.97]; October odds ratio: 0.82 [95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.97). The participants with lower educational level (no college education) experienced a sustained reduction in the odds of attempting to conceive from June 2020 to March 2021 compared with February 2020, with up to a 24% reduction in the odds of attempting to conceive in October 2020 (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.96). Among participants that were college educated, we observed an initial reduction in the odds of attempting to conceive starting in July 2020 (odds ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.99) that returned near prepandemic odds. Moreover, we observed a reduction in the odds of attempting to conceive among those with low subjective social status, with a decline in the odds of attempting to conceive beginning in July 2020 (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.10) and continuing until March 2021 (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-1.06), with the greatest reduction in odds in October 2020 (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.91). CONCLUSION: Among women in the Apple Women's Health Study cohort, our findings suggested a reduction in the odds of attempting to conceive during the COVID-19 pandemic, until March 2021, particularly among women of lower educational level and lower perceived social status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As people living with HIV now have a life expectancy approaching that of the general population, clinical care focuses increasingly on the management and prevention of comorbidities and conditions associated with aging. We aimed to assess the prevalence of physical function (PF) limitation among gay and bisexual men (GBM) and determine whether HIV is associated with severe PF limitation in this population. METHODS: We analysed cross-sectional data from GBM aged ≥55years in the Australian Positive and Peers Longevity Evaluation Study who completed a self-administered survey on health and lifestyle factors. PF was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study-Physical Functioning scale. Factors associated with severe PF limitation were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 381 men: 186 without HIV and 195 with HIV. Median age was 64.3years for GBM without HIV and 62.1years for GBM with HIV. Compared with men without HIV, those with HIV had higher proportions of severe (13.3% vs 8.1%) and moderate-to-severe (26.7% vs 24.2%) PF limitation. Severe PF limitation commonly involved difficulty with vigorous activity (95% with severe PF limitation described being limited a lot), climbing several flights of stairs (68.4% limited a lot), bending, kneeling or stooping (60.5% limited a lot), and walking 1km (55.0% limited a lot). In a model adjusted for age, body mass index, typical duration of physical activity, psychological distress, and number of comorbidities, we found a significant association between HIV and severe PF limitation (adjusted odds ratio 3.3 vs not having HIV, 95% confidence interval 1.3-8.7). CONCLUSIONS: The biological mechanisms underlying this association require further investigation, particularly given the growing age of the HIV population and inevitable increase in the burden of PF limitation.

AB  - Economical and nanomolar-level determination of the analgesic drug, acetaminophen (APAP), is reported in this work. A novel ternary nanocomposite based on silver-doped sugar apple-like cupric oxide (CuO)-decorated amine-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (fCNTs) was sonochemically prepared. CuO nanoparticles were synthesized based on the ascorbic acid-mediated low-temperature method, and sidewall functionalization of CNTs was carried out. Important characterizations of the synthesized materials were analyzed using SEM, TEM, HAADF-STEM, elemental mapping, EDX, lattice fringes, SAED pattern, XRD, EIS, UV-Vis, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and FTIR. It was noted the sonochemically prepared nanocomposite diligently fabricated on screen-printed carbon electrode showcased outstanding electrocatalytic performance towards APAP determination. The APAP sensor exhibited ultra-low limit of detection of 4 nM, wide linear concentration ranges of 0.02-3.77 and 3.77-90.02 μM, and high sensitivity of 30.45 μA μM(-1) cm(-2). Moreover, further evaluation of the sensor's performance based on electrochemical experiments showcased outstanding selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and repeatability. Further, excellent practical feasibility of the proposed APAP sensor was affirmed with excellent recovery larger than 96.86% and a maximum RSD of 3.67%.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition where the body is resistant to insulin, leading to an elevated blood glucose state. Obesity is a main factor leading to T2D. Many clinical studies, however, have described a proportion of obese individuals who express a metabolically healthy profile, whereas some lean individuals could develop metabolic disorders. To study obesity as a risk factor, body fat distribution needs to be considered rather than crude body weight. Different individuals' bodies favor storing fat in different depots; some tend to accumulate more fat in the visceral depot, while others tend to store it in the femoral depot. This tendency relies on different factors, including genetic background and lifestyle. Consuming some types of medications can cause a shift in this tendency, leading to fat redistribution. Fat distribution plays an important role in the progression of risk of insulin resistance (IR). Apple-shaped individuals with enhanced abdominal obesity have a higher risk of IR compared to BMI-matched pear-shaped individuals, who store their fat in the gluteal-femoral depots. This is related to the different adipose tissue physiology between these two depots. In this review, we will summarize the recent evidence highlighting the underlying protective mechanisms in gluteal-femoral subcutaneous adipose tissues compared to those associated with abdominal adipose tissue, and we will revise the recent evidence showing antidiabetic drugs that impact fat distribution as they manage the T2D condition.

AB  - The present study evaluated the polyphenolic contents and hypoglycemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects of the diethyl ether fraction of Thespesia garckeana using various in vitro and in vivo models. Total phenol and flavonoid contents of the extract were 613.65 ± 2.38 and 152.83 ± 1.56 mg/100 g dry weight, respectively. The extract exhibited in vitro antioxidant activities against DPPH, FRAP, LPO, and ABTS with respective half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 30.91 ± 0.23, 16.81 ± 0.51, 41.29 ± 1.82, and 42.39 ± 2.24 μg/mL. In vitro anti-inflammatory studies using membrane stabilization, protein denaturation, and proteinase activities revealed the effectiveness of the extract with respective IC(50) values of 54.45 ± 2.89, 93.62 ± 3.04, and 56.60 ± 2.34 μg/mL, while in vitro hypoglycemic analysis of the extract revealed inhibition of α-amylase (IC(50)64.59 ± 3.29 μg/mL) and enhancement of glucose uptake by yeast cells. Interestingly, the extract demonstrated in vivo hypoglycemic and anti-inflammatory effects in streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic and xylene-induced ear swelling models, respectively. In addition, the extract improved insulin secretion, attenuated pancreatic tissue distortion and oxidative stress, and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and reduced glutathione (GSH), while reducing the concentration of LPO in the diabetic rats. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis identified the presence of catechin (6.81e - 1 ppm), rutin (8.46 e - 1 ppm), myricetin, apigenin (4.019 e - 1 ppm), and luteolin (15.09 ppm) with respective retention times (RTs) of 13.64, 24.269, 27.781, 29.58, and 32.23 min, and these were subjected to a pharmacoinformatics analysis, which revealed their drug-likeness and good pharmacokinetic properties. A docking analysis hinted at the potential of luteolin, the most abundant compound in the extract, for targeting glucose-metabolizing enzymes. Thus, the present study provides preclinical insights into the bioactive constituents of T. garckeana, its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and its potential for the treatment of diabetes.

AB  - Clinical pharmacy is an umbrella of pharmaceutical services that is practiced by clinical pharmacists. Clinical pharmacists improve the quality of drug therapy, minimize the risk for drug related problems, reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with polypharmacy and decrease the overall healthcare expenditure. Consequently, clinical pharmacy is focused on both the needs of the individual patient, as well as of the healthcare system. Clinical pharmacy is now well-established and practiced worldwide and in the last two decades has been implemented successfully in Israel. This commentary maintains that the comparison of clinical pharmacy practice in Israel and in the United States, published by AJ Rose et al., has several limitations that need to be considered when devising a road map that will fit the Israeli health care system and its environment. Emphasis should be placed on the implementation of automation and robotics, promulgating regulations to allow for integration of pharmacy technicians, and allocating funds for such services.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine capsular tension ring (CTR) implantation to establish whether there are predictable movements of the CTR during deployment, indicating complicated vs uneventful implantation. SETTING: Intermountain Ocular Research Center, John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Nine cadaver eyes were prepared using standard Miyake-Apple protocol with digital video recording. A 4 o'clock-hour zonular dialysis was created, followed by a capsulorhexis and hydrodissection. In 4 eyes, a suture-guided CTR (SGCTR) injector and 8-0 nylon suture through the leading eyelet served as a visible tracer for the CTR. In 5 eyes, a standard CTR was used. The movements of the CTR during implantation were observed. RESULTS: In all eyes, SGCTR and CTR movements were predictable during implantation. All CTRs displayed cardinal movements within the injector, initially adjacent to the side of the inner diameter of the CTR. As the CTR made contact with lens or capsule, it shifted first to the center and then to the opposite side of the injector lumen. The appearance of an S-curve in the surgeon's view coincided with an obstruction of the leading eyelet and stress on the zonular fibers, as viewed with Miyake-Apple analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic CTR implantation might be avoided by understanding the characteristics of uneventful insertion vs an insertion complicated by entrapment or entanglement of the CTR. By recognizing the abnormal movements of the CTR associated with an obstruction, a surgeon might avoid iatrogenic complications.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the complication rate and time required to explant standard capsular tension rings (CTRs) vs suture-guided CTRs (SGCTRs). SETTING: Intermountain Ocular Research Center, John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Eight cadaver eyes were prepared using standard Miyake-Apple protocol with digital video recording. A 4 clock-hour zonular dialysis was created, followed by a capsulorhexis, hydrodissection, and CTR (n = 4) or SGCTR (n = 4) implantation. With the CTR hidden from view by the overlying iris, ophthalmic surgical instruments were used to remove the CTRs. Time required to remove the CTR and any complications were recorded. A limit of 180 seconds was imposed to determine inability to remove the CTR. RESULTS: In the standard CTR group (n = 4), removal was associated with high rates of complication (100%). Complications included capsular tears (n = 2), dialysis extension (n = 1), and inadvertent intracapsular cataract extraction (n = 1). The SGCTR group had no complications associated with removal (n = 4). Time required to explant a CTR was significantly reduced from 164.5 seconds with standard CTRs to 6.9 seconds with SGCTRs (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Attempts to remove a standard CTR from the capsular bag was met with a high complication rate. The addition of suture to the leading eyelet of the CTR prior to implantation significantly reduced the time and effort required to remove the CTR and was associated with a significant reduction in complication rates.

AB  - (1) Background: The purpose of the study was to comprehensively analyze the relationship between the mother's oral microbiome, modes of delivery and feeding, and the formation of the newborn child's oral microbiome. (2) Methods: This systematic review included a search through MEDLINE (PubMed) database (from 2010 to July 2020). Research was registered in PROSPERO under the number CRD42021241044. (3) Results: Of the 571 studies, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Included studies were classified according to (i) child's delivery mode, (ii) maternal exposure to antibiotics and disinfectants, and (iii) feeding type. (4) Conclusions: The interpretation of these papers shows that the type of delivery, maternal exposure to disinfectants and antibiotics during delivery, maternal health classed as overweight, gestational diabetes mellitus, and feeding type are correlated to changes in the maternal and neonatal early oral microbiomes, based on the analysis provided in this systematic review. Because no evidence exists regarding the impact of maternal diet and maternal oral health on the establishment and development of the early oral newborn microbiome, more studies are needed to deepen the knowledge and understanding of the subject and develop preventive and therapeutic strategies of support to pregnant women.

AB  - There are a large number of mobile applications that allow the monitoring of health status. The quality of the applications is only evaluated by users and not by standard criteria. This study aimed to examine depression-related applications in major mobile application stores and to analyze them using the rating scale tool Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). A search of digital applications for the control of symptoms and behavioral changes in depression was carried out in the two reference mobile operating systems, Apple (App Store) and Android (Play Store), by means of two reviewers with a blind methodology between September and October 2019 in stores from Spain and the United Kingdom. Eighteen applications from the Android Play Store and twelve from the App Store were included in this study. The quality of the applications was evaluated using the MARS scale from 1 (inadequate) to 5 (excellent). The average score of the applications based on the MARS was 3.67 ± 0.53. The sections with the highest scores were "Functionality" (4.51) and "Esthetics" (3.98) and the lowest "Application Subjective quality" (2.86) and "Information" (3.08). Mobile Health applications for the treatment of depression have great potential to influence the health status of users; however, applications come to the digital market without health control.

AB  - Compartment-based infectious disease models that consider the transmission rate (or contact rate) as a constant during the course of an epidemic can be limiting regarding effective capture of the dynamics of infectious disease. This study proposed a novel approach based on a dynamic time-varying transmission rate with a control rate governing the speed of disease spread, which may be associated with the information related to infectious disease intervention. Integration of multiple sources of data with disease modelling has the potential to improve modelling performance. Taking the global mobility trend of vehicle driving available via Apple Maps as an example, this study explored different ways of processing the mobility trend data and investigated their relationship with the control rate. The proposed method was evaluated based on COVID-19 data from six European countries. The results suggest that the proposed model with dynamic transmission rate improved the performance of model fitting and forecasting during the early stage of the pandemic. Positive correlation has been found between the average daily change of mobility trend and control rate. The results encourage further development for incorporation of multiple resources into infectious disease modelling in the future.

AB  - Starting with the dichotomous view of Kraepelin, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have traditionally been considered as separate entities. More recent, this taxonomic view of illnesses has been challenged and a continuum psychosis has been postulated based on genetic and neurobiological findings suggestive of a large overlap between disorders. In this paper we will review clinical and experimental data from genetics, morphology, phenomenology and illness progression demonstrating what makes schizophrenia and bipolar disorder different conditions, challenging the idea of the obsolescence of the categorical approach. However, perhaps it is also time to move beyond DSM and search for more refined clinical descriptions that could uncover clinical invariants matching better with molecular data. In the future, computational psychiatry employing artificial intelligence and machine learning might provide us a tool to overcome the gap between clinical descriptions (phenomenology) and neurobiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies indicate that approximately a third of dementia cases are attributable to modifiable cardiometabolic, physical and mental health, and social and lifestyle risk factors. There is evidence that intensive behaviour change interventions targeting these factors can reduce cognitive decline. [Figure: see text] METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will design and test a low intensity, secondary dementia-prevention programme (Active Prevention in People at risk of dementia: Lifestyle, bEhaviour change and Technology to REducE cognitive and functional decline, "APPLE-Tree") to slow cognitive decline in people with subjective cognitive decline with or without objective cognitive impairment. We will embed our work within social science research to understand how dementia prevention is currently delivered and structured. We will carry out systematic reviews and around 50 qualitative interviews with stakeholders, using findings to coproduce the APPLE-Tree intervention. We plan a 10-session group intervention, involving personalised goal-setting, with individual sessions for those unable or unwilling to attend groups, delivered by psychology assistants who will be trained and supervised by clinical psychologists. The coproduction group (including public and patient involvement [PPI], academic and clinical/third-sector professional representatives) will use the Behaviour Change Wheel theoretical framework to develop it. We will recruit and randomly allocate 704 participants, 1:1 to the intervention: informational control group. This sample size is sufficient to detect a between-group difference at 2 years of 0.15 on the primary outcome (cognition: modified neuropsychological test battery; 90% power, 5% significance, effect size 0.25, SD 0.6). DISSEMINATION: We will work with Public Health England and third-sector partners to produce an effective national implementation approach, so that if our intervention works, it is used in practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The article by Marryat, Thompson and Wilson (2017) in BMC Pediatrics presents an evaluation of the implementation of the Triple P system as a public health intervention conducted by the Glasgow City Council and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. DISCUSSION: Unfortunately, the conclusions drawn are questionable for multiple reasons. The lack of a controlled design precludes defensible conclusions about intervention effects free from routine threats to internal validity. There was a substantial mismatch between the intervention sample and the population sample assessed. The article's title and abstract leave readers with the mistaken impression that the children assessed for outcome were suitably representative of intervention families, when in fact many of the children in the intervention families were missing from the teacher-report outcome assessment (a single questionnaire), and many or most of the children in the teacher-report outcome assessment belonged to families who had never received the intervention. Although Triple P targets parent-child relations and child behavioural and emotional problems at home, Marryat et al. narrowly defined mental health impact as child difficulties in nursery or preschool, while not reporting data from practitioners and parents in the same evaluation that did not support the authors' conclusion. The paper was further diminished by a number of misleading statements and factual errors related for example to other research on Triple P. Studying the extent to which child mental health functioning at home can generalise to school settings is an important topic of inquiry in relation to parenting support interventions, but unfortunately the Marryat et al. article did not move this area forward.
